## 1. Introduction to Django

Django is a full-featured web framework designed for **rapid development** and **clean, pragmatic design**. It's built on the principle of **"Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)"**, allowing you to focus on your application's functionality by providing reusable components.

### Key Features

- **MVT Architecture**: Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) structure, separating data management, business logic, and presentation:
    - **Model**: Manages the data and defines the database schema.
    - **View**: Retrieves data from models and sends it to templates.
    - **Template**: Handles the presentation layer, rendering dynamic HTML pages.
- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper)**: Converts Python classes into database tables, letting you interact with the database seamlessly.
- **Built-in Admin Interface**: Offers a ready-to-use interface for managing data, making it easy for non-developers to handle the backend.

> Understanding database terminology is essential because Django's ORM translates database concepts into Python code, letting developers work with databases more intuitively.

### Database terms

Here is a breakdown of commonly used database terms in Django and web development:

#### Schema

- **Definition**: A schema in database terminology defines the structure of the database. It outlines how data is organized, including tables, fields, relationships, and constraints.
- **In Django**: Each Django model corresponds to a database table. For instance, creating a `User` model in Django will automatically create a `User` table in the database with columns matching the fields defined in the model.

#### Column (or Field)

- **Definition**: A column represents a specific attribute or property within a table. Each column has a data type and stores one aspect of data about the entity.
- **In Django**: Fields in Django models correspond to columns in the database table. For example, defining a `CharField` for a username in a model would create a `username` column in the associated table.

#### Row (or Record)

- **Definition**: A row, also known as a record, is a single entry in a table, representing one instance of the entity. Each row contains data in columns defined by the table's schema.
- **In Django**: When a new object instance is created in Django (like creating a new user), Django ORM inserts a new row in the table corresponding to that model, filling columns based on the instance's attributes.

#### Primary Key

- **Definition**: A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table. No two rows can have the same primary key value.
- **In Django**: Django automatically adds a primary key field called `id` to each model. You can specify a different primary key field if you want by setting `primary_key=True` on any field.

#### Foreign Key

- **Definition**: A foreign key is a reference to a primary key in another table, establishing a relationship between two tables.
- **In Django**: Foreign keys are used in Django models to link two models. For instance, if you have an `Order` model that needs to relate to a `User` model, you'd use a foreign key to point from `Order` to `User`.

#### Index

- **Definition**: An index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval. An index is built on one or more columns and allows quick searching.
- **In Django**: You can specify indexed fields in Django models to optimize queries on frequently searched columns. Django automatically indexes primary keys, but additional indexes can be added if needed.

#### Constraints

- **Definition**: Constraints enforce rules at the database level to ensure data integrity, such as unique constraints, not null constraints, and foreign key constraints.
- **In Django**: Constraints can be added in Django models to ensure that certain fields are unique (`unique=True`), required (by setting `null=False` and `blank=False`), or match specific criteria (using model Meta options like `unique_together`).

#### Query

- **Definition**: A query is a request for data from the database. It can be a request to retrieve, update, insert, or delete data.
- **In Django**: Queries are made through Django's ORM. For example, `User.objects.all()` retrieves all users, while `User.objects.filter(name="John")` retrieves only users with the name "John".

## 2. Setting up Django

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install Python** (if not already installed): macOS usually comes with Python 2 pre-installed. To use Python 3, install it using Homebrew (if Homebrew isn't installed, see below).

    ```bash
    # Install Homebrew (if necessary)
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

    # Use Homebrew to install Python 3
    brew install python
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Using virtual environments isolates project dependencies. To create one, run:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv myenv
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Activate the virtual environment with the following command:

    ```bash
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```

4. **Install Django**: Once the environment is active, install Django using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install django
    ```

5. **Start a Django Project**: With Django installed, create a new project using the `startproject` command:

    ```bash
    django-admin startproject myproject
    cd myproject
    ```

6. **Run the Development Server**: Start the server to verify that everything is set up correctly:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py runserver
    ```

Open a browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see Django's welcome page.

---

## 3. Django Project Structure

Django's default project structure is organized for efficient project management.

- **manage.py**: The command-line utility for managing Django commands.
- **settings.py**: Contains configuration settings (database setup, installed apps, middleware).
- **urls.py**: Manages URL routing to direct requests to views.
- **wsgi.py** and **asgi.py**: Web server interfaces for deployment compatibility.

#### Example Configuration

- **Database Configurations**: By default, Django uses SQLite. However, for more robust databases like PostgreSQL, update the `DATABASES` configuration in `settings.py`

### PostgreSQL Example (optional)

Install PostgreSQL using Homebrew and configure `settings.py`:

```bash
brew install postgresql
```

Update `settings.py` to configure PostgreSQL:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        'USER': 'myuser',
        'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432'
    }
}
```

Replace `'myuser'` and `'mypassword'` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

---

## 4. Apps in Django

Django projects are organized into **apps**, each responsible for specific functionality. This modular approach improves maintainability and scalability.

### Creating an App

To create a new app, use the following command:

```bash
python3 manage.py startapp myapp
```

This command creates a directory structure within `myapp`:
- **models.py**: Defines the data models for the app.
- **views.py**: Contains logic to process requests and responses.
- **urls.py** (optional): Defines URL routing specific to this app.
- **templates/**: Holds HTML templates for the app.
- **static/**: Stores static assets like CSS and JavaScript files.

### Registering an App

To enable the app in your project, add it to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

```python
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # Default apps
    'myapp',    # Add your new app here
]
```

By organizing each function into an app, Django encourages reusability and clean architecture.

---

## 5. URLs and Views

In Django, **URLs** and **views** work together to handle incoming requests and generate responses. URLs serve as entry points to different parts of your application, while views process those requests, retrieve necessary data, and pass it to templates for rendering into HTML or JSON responses.

### URL Routing in Django

Django has a powerful URL routing system, where each URL pattern corresponds to a specific view. The URL dispatcher matches incoming URLs to a predefined list of patterns defined in `urls.py` files across your project and individual apps.

#### Defining URL Patterns in `urls.py`

Every Django app typically has its own `urls.py` file, where you define specific routes for that app. The project’s main `urls.py` file, located in the root directory, consolidates app-specific URLs to create a central routing system.

Here’s an example of defining a URL pattern in an app-specific `urls.py` file:

```python
# myapp/urls.py
from django.urls import path    # Import path for defining URLs
from . import views             # Import views to link functions to URLs

# Define URL patterns for the app
urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', views.hello_world, name='hello_world'),  # Maps /hello/ to hello_world view
]
```

In this example:

- `path('hello/', views.hello_world, name='hello_world')`: This line connects the URL `hello/` to the `hello_world` view.
- The `name` **parameter** assigns a name to the URL pattern (`hello_world`). Named URLs are useful for reverse URL resolution, which allows you to refer to URLs by name rather than hard-coding paths throughout your code.

#### Including App URLs in the Main `urls.py` File

To organize routing better, Django’s `urls.py` files in apps are often included in the project’s main `urls.py` file. This way, all routes are centralized and easier to manage:

```python
# project_root/urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include  # Include to add app URLs

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),  # Route for Django’s built-in admin panel
    path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),  # Includes all URLs defined in myapp/urls.py
]
```

Here, include(`'myapp.urls'`) tells Django to look inside the `myapp/urls.py` file for additional URL patterns. Requests that start with `myapp/` will be routed based on the definitions in `myapp/urls.py`.

### Views in Django

Views are functions or classes that process incoming requests, interact with the database (using models), and return responses, usually HTML or JSON. Django supports two main types of views:

1. **Function-Based Views (FBVs)**
2. **Class-Based Views (CBVs)**

Both are commonly used, and each has advantages depending on the complexity and reuse needs of the view.

#### Function-Based Views (FBVs)

FBVs are simple Python functions that receive an HTTP request object and return an HTTP response. FBVs are straightforward and ideal for simpler views with minimal logic.

Example of a Function-Based View:

```python
# myapp/views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse  # Import HttpResponse to return text-based responses

def hello_world(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")  # Response text is returned directly
```

Here:
- `hello_world` is a function that takes `request` as a parameter.
- It returns an `HttpResponse` with the text `"Hello, world!"`, which will be displayed when someone visits the `/hello/` URL.

#### Class-Based Views (CBVs)

CBVs are Python classes that provide greater flexibility, reusability, and organization, especially for complex views. Django includes several built-in CBVs, such as `TemplateView`, `ListView`, and `DetailView`, that handle common web application patterns.

Example of a Class-Based View:

```python
# myapp/views.py
from django.views import View  # Import View for creating class-based views
from django.http import HttpResponse

class HelloWorldView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")  # Handles GET requests with a simple response
```

In this example:
- `HelloWorldView` is a class inheriting from Django’s base `View` class.
- The `get` **method** defines what happens when the view receives a GET request. It returns an `HttpResponse` with the text `"Hello, world!"`.
- This CBV can be expanded to handle other HTTP methods, like POST or PUT, by adding corresponding methods (e.g., `post`, `put`).

#### Linking URLs to Class-Based Views

To connect a CBV to a URL, you must call `.as_view()` on the view class in `urls.py`. This tells Django to handle the view class as a function, which is compatible with URL routing.

```python
# myapp/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import HelloWorldView

urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', HelloWorldView.as_view(), name='hello_world'),  # CBV mapped to URL
]
```

### Differences Between FBVs and CBVs

- **FBVs**: Simpler to write and ideal for views with minimal logic. Each HTTP method requires separate views if different logic is needed.
- **CBVs**: More structured and reusable, especially for views that require similar logic for different HTTP methods. You can create custom views by extending Django’s generic CBVs, making them powerful for complex applications.

## 6. Templates and Static Files

Django templates enable dynamic HTML rendering, while static files manage assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.

### Template Example

Django templates support loops, conditionals, and variable substitution:

```html
<!-- myapp/templates/greet.html -->
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
    <head>
        <title>Greeting</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Configuring Static Files

In `settings.py`, define the paths for static files:

```python
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
```

Place static assets in each app's **static/** directory to keep them organized and easily accessible.

---

## 7. Models and Databases

In Django, **models** represent the core data structure of your application. They define what data is stored, how it's organized, and the relationships between different entities. Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) translates these models into **database tables**, allowing you to interact with your database using Python instead of SQL.

### Defining a Model

Each Django model is represented as a class in Python, inheriting from `models.Model`. Each attribute of the model class corresponds to a **column** in the database table. When you define a model Django's ORM automatically creates a table in the database with the appropriate fields and relationships.

Example of a simple model definition in Django:

```python
# myapp/models.py
from django.db import models    # Import the models module

class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)     # Defines a CharField for names
    age = models.IntegerField()                # Defines an IntegerField for ages
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)      # Defines a EmailField with a uniqueness constraint
```

In this example:

- `Person` is a model that represents a table in the database. Each instance of `Person` corresponds to a row in that table.
- **Fields**: `name`, `age`, and `email` are fields in the `Person` model, representing columns in the `Person` table. Each field is defined using a specific **field type** (e.g., `CharField`, `IntegerField`, `EmailField`), which determines the data type of the column.

### How Django Uses Models to Create Database Tables

When you run the command `python manage.py migrate`, Django checks the models and creates corresponding tables in the database if they don't already exist. It also applies any changes made to models through migrations, keeping the database schema synchronized with your models.

### Common Field Types in Django Models

Django provides a wide range of field types to represent different types of data. Here are some of the most commonly used fields:

1. **CharField**: Used for short text, such as names or titles.
    - Example: `name = models.CharField(max_length=100)`
    - The `max_length` argument specifies the maximum number of characters allowed.
2. **IntegerField**: Stores integer data.
    - Example: `age = models.IntegerField()`
    - Useful for storing numeric values, like age, quantity, or other counts.
3. **DateTimeField**: Stores date and time information.
    - Example: `create_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)`
    - `auto_now_add=True` option automatically sets this field to the current date and time when the object is first created.
4. **EmailField**: Stores email addresses, with optional validation for email format.
    - Example: `email = models.EmailField(unique=True)`
    - The `unique=True` argument enforces a uniqueness constraint on the field, ensuring no two `Person` objects can have the same email address.
5. **TextField**: Used for longer text entries.
    - Example: `bio = models.TextField()`
    - Useful for descriptions, comments, or other text that doesn't have a strict character limit.
6. **BooleanField**: Stores True/False values.
    - Example: `is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)`
    - Used for numerical data that may contain decimal points, like prices or ratings.
7. **FloatField**: Stores floating-point numbers.
    - Example: `price = models.FloatField()`
    - Used for numerical data that may contain decimal points, like prices or ratings.

### Defining Model Relationships

In addition to fields, models can define **relationship** between different tables. Django supports three primary types of relationships:


#### 1. One-to-Many Relationship (ForeignKey)

- A one-to-many relationship means each row in one table can relate to multiple rows in another table. For example, if each `Book` is written by a single `Author`, but each `Author` can write multiple `Books`, this would be a one-to-many relationship.
- **ForeignKey** is used to represent one-to-many relationship.

Example:

```python
class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

- Here, each `Book` is related to an `Author` through the `author` field, which is a `ForeignKey`.
- `on_delete=models.CASCADE` specifies that if an `Author` is deleted, all their `Books` should be deleted as well. Other options include `SET_NULL` (set the field to null) and `PROTECT` (prevent deletion of the related object).

#### 2. Many-to-Many Relationship (ManyToManyField)

- A many-to-many relationship allows each row in one table to relate to multiple rows in another, and vice versa. For example, if `Students` can enroll in multiple `Courses` and each `Course` can have multiple `Students`, this is a many-to-many relationship.
- **ManyToManyField** is used to represent many-to-many relationships.

Example:

```python
class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    courses = models.ManyToManyField('Course')

class Course(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
```

- Here, each `Student` can enroll in multiple `Courses`, and each `Course` can have multiple `Students`.
- Django creates an **intermediate table** to manage this relationship automatically, which is invisible to the user.

#### 3. One-to-One Relationship (OneToOneField)

- A one-to-one relationship links a single row in one table to a single row in another. This can be useful for extending the data of a model without modifying the original table. For example, a `UserProfile` could be linked to a single `User`.
- **OneToOneField** is used to represent one-to-one relationships.

Example:

```python
class User(models.Model):
    username = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class UserProfile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    bio = models.TextField()
```

- Here, each `UserProfile` is uniquely associated with a single `User`.

### Adding Constraints in Models

Django allows you to set constraints on fields to enforce data integrity and uniqueness. Some common constraints include:

1. **Unique Constraint**: Ensures no duplicate values in a field. This is specified by setting `unique=True` on a field, as in `email = models.EmailField(unique=True)`.
2. **Not Null Constraint**: Ensures that a field cannot be empty by setting `null=False` (default behavior in Django). For instance, `name = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=False)` ensures `name` cannot be left blank in the database.
3. **Default Value**: Sets a default value if no value is provided. For example, `is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)`.
4. **Custom Constraints**: Django supports advanced constraints using model `Meta` options or by defining `unique_together` or `constraints` within the model.
    ```python
    class Person(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        email = models.EmailField()

        class Meta:
            unique_together = ('name', 'email')     # Enforces unique name-email pair
    ```

## 8. Migrations

In Django, **migrations** are a way of managing and tracking changes in your database schema as your models evolve. As you modify model definitions—such as adding fields, creating new models, or altering existing relationships—Django uses migrations to automatically translate these changes into database commands that update the underlying database structure.

Migrations are essential for keeping your database in sync with your model definitions and ensuring that changes are applied consistently across different environments (like development, testing, and production).

### Understanding Django’s Migration System

Django’s migration system operates in two main steps:

1. **Creating Migration Files**: These files describe the changes made to your models and are stored in your Django app’s migrations directory.
2. **Applying Migrations**: This step executes the changes defined in the migration files, altering the actual database schema.

#### Step 1: Creating Migration Files

Whenever you make changes to your models (for example, adding a new field, modifying a field type, or creating a new model), you need to create a migration file. This file contains the instructions Django will use to apply the model changes to your database.

To create a migration file, use the following command:

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
```

This command:

- Scans all of your models for any changes.
- Generates a migration file in each app’s `migrations` folder for any models that have been modified.
- Names the file with a sequential number and a description (e.g., `0001_initial.py` for the first migration or `0002_add_email_field.py` if you added an email field).

Each migration file includes a **list of operations** that Django will execute when you apply the migration. Here’s an example of what a simple migration file might look like:

```python
# Generated migration file in myapp/migrations/0002_add_email_field.py

from django.db import migrations, models

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('myapp', '0001_initial'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.AddField(
            model_name='person',
            name='email',
            field=models.EmailField(max_length=254, unique=True),
        ),
    ]
```

In this example:

- `dependencies` specify the migration(s) that must be applied before this one. Here, it depends on `0001_initial`, meaning it needs the initial schema setup.
- `operations` define what changes are made in this migration. In this case, it adds an `email` field to the `Person` model.

#### Step 2: Applying Migrations

Once migration files are created, you apply them to the database with the following command:

```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
```

The `migrate` command:

- Reads the migration files in each app’s `migrations` folder.
- Checks the database to see which migrations have already been applied (tracking this in a special `django_migrations` table).
- Applies any migrations that haven’t yet been applied to update the database schema.

Applying migrations is crucial because it ensures the database matches your current models, preventing runtime errors and data integrity issues.

### How Migrations Work Internally

Django’s migration system keeps track of each migration in a special database table called `django_migrations`. This table stores the names of applied migrations, so Django knows which migrations are pending. When you run `migrate`, Django only applies migrations that haven’t been applied yet, which keeps everything in sync without re-running previous migrations.

### Example of Creating and Applying Migrations

Let’s say you start with a simple `Person` model:

```python
# myapp/models.py
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()
```

1. **Initial Migration**: After creating this model, you generate an initial migration file.

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    ```
    Django will create a migration file `0001_initial.py` that defines the creation of the `Person` table with `name` and `age` fields.

2. **Applying Initial Migration**: Apply the migration to create the initial schema in the database.

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```
    Now, the `Person` table is created in the database with columns for `name` and `age`.

3. **Adding a Field**: Suppose you add an email field to the Person model:

    ```python
    # myapp/models.py
    class Person(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        age = models.IntegerField()
        email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    ```

4. **Creating a New Migration**: Run `makemigrations` again to create a new migration that adds the `email` field to the `Person` model.

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    ```
    This generates `0002_add_email_field.py` with instructions to add the `email` column.

5. **Applying the New Migration**: Finally, run `migrate` to apply this new migration to the database.

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```
    Now, the `email` field has been added to the Person table in the database.

### Migration Dependencies

Each migration file specifies **dependencies** to ensure migrations are applied in the correct order. For example, if you create a migration to add a new field, it will depend on the initial migration that created the table. Django will only apply a migration after its dependencies have been applied.

### Rollbacks and Managing Migration States

Django migrations also support rolling back changes using the migrate command:

```bash
python3 manage.py migrate myapp 0001
```

This command reverts the `myapp` app to migration `0001`, effectively rolling back any changes made by subsequent migrations. This is useful during development if you need to backtrack after making unwanted changes.

### Types of Migration Operations

Django provides various **migration operations** to handle different types of schema changes. Some of the most common operations include:

- **AddField**: Adds a new field to an existing model/table.
- **RemoveField**: Removes a field from a model/table.
- **AlterField**: Changes the properties of an existing field (e.g., max length or nullability).
- **RenameField**: Renames a field within a model/table.
- **CreateModel**: Creates a new table in the database.
- **DeleteModel**: Deletes an entire table from the database.

These operations are automatically generated by makemigrations based on changes in the model definitions.

### Benefits of Django Migrations

1. **Version Control for Database Schema**: Migrations provide a clear history of database schema changes, making it easy to track, review, and apply changes across different environments.

2. **Collaboration**: Migrations are tracked in version control (e.g., Git), so developers working on the same project can share schema changes.

3. **Automated Schema Management**: Migrations handle complex schema updates, such as adding fields or altering relationships, automatically. This reduces manual SQL writing and helps prevent human errors.

## 9. Django Admin Panel

Django’s **admin panel** is a built-in interface for managing your application's data, providing a simple GUI to view, add, update, and delete records from the database. It’s ideal for internal use, allowing non-technical users to interact with the data without requiring SQL knowledge or custom views.

### Enabling the Admin Panel

To activate the admin panel, register your models in `admin.py` for each app. Django automatically generates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all registered models.

1. **Registering Models in the Admin Interface**

    To make a model accessible in the admin, import it in `admin.py` and register it with Django’s `admin.site.register()` function.

    ```python
    # myapp/admin.py
    from django.contrib import admin
    from .models import Person
    
    admin.site.register(Person)
    ```

    In this example, `Person` will now be visible in the admin panel.

2. **Accessing the Admin Interface**

    The admin interface is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`. Before accessing it, create a superuser (admin account) to log in:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    You’ll be prompted to set a username, email, and password for the superuser.

### Customizing the Admin Panel

The Django admin panel can be customized to control how models and data are displayed:

1. **Displaying Specific Fields in List View**

    Use `list_display` in a custom `ModelAdmin` class to specify fields shown in the list view.

    ```python
    # myapp/admin.py
    class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        list_display = ('name', 'age', 'email')
    
    admin.site.register(Person, PersonAdmin)
    ```

2. **Adding Filters and Search Fields**

    - `list_filter`: Adds filters in the admin panel sidebar.
    - `search_fields`: Allows search functionality across specified fields.

    ```python
    class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        list_display = ('name', 'age', 'email')
        list_filter = ('age',)              # Adds a filter for 'age'
        search_fields = ('name', 'email')   # Enables search by 'name' and 'email'

    admin.site.register(Person, PersonAdmin)
    ```

3. **Fieldsets and Inline Models**

    You can organize fields into sections using `fieldsets`, and display related models within a parent model using `InlineModelAdmin`.
    ```python
    class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        fieldsets = (
            ('Personal Info', {'fields': ('name', 'email')}),
            ('Additional Info', {'fields': ('age',)}),
        )
    ```
Django’s admin panel can be a powerful tool for managing data, enabling robust customization without much additional code.

## 10. Forms and User Input

Forms in Django simplify data collection and validation by offering built-in tools to handle both user-generated and internal data entry. Django forms can be created manually or generated directly from models.

### Creating Forms Manually

Manual forms provide flexibility and can be created by defining fields and validation logic.

```python
# myapp/forms.py
from django import forms

class ContactForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = forms.EmailField()
    message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)
```

### ModelForm: Generating Forms from Models

ModelForm is a form created directly from a Django model, which makes it easy to handle model instances in forms.

```python
from django.forms import ModelForm
from .models import Person

class PersonForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Person
        fields = ['name', 'age', 'email']
```

### Handling Form Submission

To process form data, views in Django typically:

1. Instantiate the form with request data (`POST`).
2. Validate the data (`form.is_valid()`).
3. Save the form data if valid.

```python
# myapp/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .forms import PersonForm

def add_person(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = PersonForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('person_list')  # Redirect after saving
    else:
        form = PersonForm()
    return render(request, 'add_person.html', {'form': form})
```

In this example:

- A form instance is created with `request.POST` data.
- Upon validation, `form.save()` inserts the data into the database.
- `redirect` sends the user to another page upon successful submission.

Django forms provide a simple, yet powerful, way to collect and process user input, with the advantage of automatic validation.

## 11. Django QuerySet API

The QuerySet API is Django’s powerful tool for querying databases. It abstracts SQL operations, enabling complex data retrieval and manipulation through Python code. Each QuerySet represents a collection of database rows, allowing developers to chain filters, perform aggregations, and retrieve specific data.

### Basic QuerySet Methods

1. **Retrieving All Records**

    ```python
    people = Person.objects.all()
    ```

2. **Filtering Records**
    
    Filters retrieve records that meet specified conditions, supporting lookups such as `exact`, `iexact` (case-insensitive), and `contains`.

    ```python
    adults = Person.objects.filter(age__gte=18)  # People aged 18 or older
    ```

3. **Excluding Records**

    Exclude specific records based on conditions.

    ```python
    non_adults = Person.objects.exclude(age__gte=18)
    ```

4. **Ordering Results**

    Order records by one or more fields. Prefix the field with a hyphen (`-`) for descending order.

    ```python
    ordered_people = Person.objects.order_by('name')  # Ascending by name
    ```

5. **Limiting Results**

    QuerySets are lazy, meaning they don’t retrieve data until explicitly requested. Use slicing to limit records, like with lists.

    ```python
    first_five_people = Person.objects.all()[:5]  # Retrieves the first 5 records
    ```

### Aggregation and Annotation

Aggregations compute summary values across records, like `Count`, `Sum`, and `Average`.

```python
from django.db.models import Avg

average_age = Person.objects.aggregate(Avg('age'))  # Average age of all people
```

### Common QuerySet Lookups

Django offers a wide range of lookups for flexibility:

- `__gte` and `__lte`: Greater than or equal to, less than or equal to.
- `__icontains`: Case-insensitive substring match.
- `__in`: Checks if a value is within a specified list.

For instance, to get all `Person` records where the name contains “John” (case-insensitive):

```python
johns = Person.objects.filter(name__icontains='john')
```

The QuerySet API in Django is versatile and provides the power to query data efficiently without writing raw SQL, supporting a wide range of applications from simple CRUD to complex analytics.

---

## 12. Class-Based Views (CBVs)

Class-Based Views (CBVs) in Django provide a structured, reusable way to create views that require similar logic across multiple parts of an application. Django offers built-in CBVs, such as `ListView`, `DetailView`, `CreateView`, `UpdateView`, and `DeleteView`, simplifying CRUD operations.

### Built-in Class-Based Views

Django’s generic CBVs handle many common tasks out of the box:

1. **ListView**: Displays a list of objects.
2. **DetailView**: Shows details of a single object.
3. **CreateView**: Provides a form to create a new object.
4. **UpdateView**: Renders a form to update an existing object.
5. **DeleteView**: Confirms and deletes an object.

### Example of a ListView

To display a list of `Person` objects:

```python
# myapp/views.py
from django.views.generic import ListView
from .models import Person

class PersonListView(ListView):
    model = Person
    template_name = 'person_list.html'
    context_object_name = 'people'
```

### Example of a CreateView

To create a new Person record using a form:

```python
# myapp/views.py
from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView
from .models import Person

class PersonCreateView(CreateView):
    model = Person
    fields = ['name', 'age', 'email']
    template_name = 'person_form.html'
    success_url = '/people/'  # Redirect URL after successful submission
```

### Using CBVs in URL Configuration

To connect a CBV to a URL, use `.as_view()` in `urls.py`:

```python
# myapp/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import PersonListView, PersonCreateView

urlpatterns = [
    path('people/', PersonListView.as_view(), name='person_list'),
    path('people/add/', PersonCreateView.as_view(), name='person_add'),
]
```

### CBV Advantages Over FBVs

- **Reusability**: CBVs allow inheritance and can be extended to share common logic.
- **Cleaner Code**: CBVs often reduce boilerplate, especially for CRUD operations.
- **Modularity**: Easily handles different HTTP methods within the same class (e.g., GET, POST).

CBVs provide a powerful way to manage views, particularly for CRUD operations, by encapsulating functionality into reusable classes.

## 13. Middleware
Middleware in Django is a way to process requests and responses globally before they reach views or are sent back to the client. Middleware functions are applied in a sequence, allowing you to handle cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, logging, or request throttling.

### Using Built-in Middleware
Django includes several built-in middleware classes, which you can enable in `settings.py`:

```python
# settings.py
MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
]
```

### Creating Custom Middleware

To create custom middleware, define a class with methods for request and response processing. Place the middleware in an app file, such as `middleware.py`.

```python
# myapp/middleware.py
class CustomHeaderMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        response = self.get_response(request)
        response['X-Custom-Header'] = 'Custom Value'
        return response
```

Register it in `MIDDLEWARE` by adding the path:

```python
# settings.py
MIDDLEWARE.append('myapp.middleware.CustomHeaderMiddleware')
```

In this example, `CustomHeaderMiddleware` adds a custom header to all responses.

### Types of Middleware
1. **SecurityMiddleware**: Handles security settings, like HTTPS redirection.
2. **AuthenticationMiddleware**: Associates requests with logged-in users.
3. **SessionMiddleware**: Manages user sessions, storing data on the server.

Middleware in Django is a powerful mechanism for modifying requests and responses globally, making it ideal for functionality that spans across multiple views.

## 14. Authentication and Authorization

Django provides a robust, built-in **authentication and authorization** system for managing users, permissions, and access control. This system includes models, views, and forms for handling user registration, login, logout, and permission-based access control.

### Core Components of Authentication in Django

1. **User Model**: Django's default `User` model represents individual users, storing attributes like `username`, `email`, `password`, `is_active`, and `is_superuser`.

    ```python
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    ```

2. **Authentication Views**: Django includes built-in views for login, logout, and password management. These views can be used out of the box or customized as needed.

3. **Permissions**: Django’s permission system allows you to define access control at the model level. Each model can have `add`, `change`, `delete`, and `view` permissions, and custom permissions can also be added.

### Setting Up Authentication

To create a user authentication system, add the required configurations to `urls.py` and use Django’s built-in views.

1. **Creating User Registration and Login Forms**

    For user registration, you can create a form using Django’s built-in User model.

    ```python
    # myapp/forms.py
    from django import forms
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User

    class UserRegistrationForm(forms.ModelForm):
        password = forms.CharField(widget=forms.PasswordInput)

        class Meta:
            model = User
            fields = ['username', 'email', 'password']
    ```

2. **Login and Logout Views**

    Django provides built-in views for login and logout, which can be easily configured in `urls.py`.

    ```python
    # myapp/urls.py
    from django.urls import path
    from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views

    urlpatterns = [
        path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(), name='login'),
        path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='logout'),
    ]
    ```

3. **Restricting Access with `@login_required` Decorator**

    Use the `@login_required` decorator to restrict access to views that should only be accessible to logged-in users.

    ```python
    # myapp/views.py
    from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
    from django.shortcuts import render

    @login_required
    def dashboard(request):
        return render(request, 'dashboard.html')
    ```

4. **Permissions and Authorization**

    Permissions in Django can be managed at the model level using permissions on custom models or with groups and roles. This can be combined with the @permission_required decorator for finer control.

    ```python
    from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required

    @permission_required('myapp.can_view_dashboard')
    def restricted_view(request):
        return render(request, 'restricted.html')
    ```

Django’s authentication framework is highly customizable, allowing you to handle everything from basic user login to advanced permissions and custom authentication workflows.

## 15. Signals

Django signals provide a way for components to get notified when certain events occur elsewhere in the framework. They allow decoupled components to “listen” for events and trigger specific actions without requiring direct calls.

### Commonly Used Signals

1. `post_save` and `pre_save`: Triggered before or after saving an object.
2. `post_delete` and `pre_delete`: Triggered before or after deleting an object.
3. `m2m_changed`: Triggered when a many-to-many relationship is modified.

### Example: Using `post_save` Signal to Send a Notification

Let’s create a `post_save` signal that sends an email notification each time a new `Person` instance is saved.

```python
# myapp/signals.py
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.core.mail import send_mail
from .models import Person

@receiver(post_save, sender=Person)
def send_notification(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        send_mail(
            'New Person Added',
            f'A new person, {instance.name}, has been added.',
            'admin@example.com',
            ['admin@example.com'],
            fail_silently=False,
        )
```

### Registering Signals in `apps.py`

To ensure signals are registered, import the `signals.py` file in your app’s `apps.py`:

```python
# myapp/apps.py
from django.apps import AppConfig

class MyAppConfig(AppConfig):
    name = 'myapp'

    def ready(self):
        import myapp.signals  # Import signals when the app is ready
```

And then set `default_app_config` in `__init__.py`:

```python
# myapp/__init__.py
default_app_config = 'myapp.apps.MyAppConfig'
```

Django signals are an efficient way to handle loosely coupled event-based logic, enabling you to extend your app’s functionality in response to database actions without modifying core code.

## 16. Testing in Django

Django’s testing framework provides tools for writing and running tests to ensure your code works as expected. It includes test cases for views, models, and forms, making it easier to validate and maintain code quality.

### Writing Unit Tests with `TestCase`

Django’s `TestCase` class provides a clean setup for testing models and views.

1. **Testing Models**

    You can test model behaviors, such as default values or field constraints, by creating objects and asserting expected results.

    ```python
    # myapp/tests.py
    from django.test import TestCase
    from .models import Person

    class PersonModelTest(TestCase):
        def setUp(self):
            self.person = Person.objects.create(name="Alice", age=30)

        def test_person_creation(self):
            self.assertEqual(self.person.name, "Alice")
            self.assertEqual(self.person.age, 30)
    ```

2. **Testing Views**

    Test views by simulating requests and asserting the correct templates or responses.

    ```python
    from django.urls import reverse

    class PersonListViewTest(TestCase):
        def test_view_url_exists_at_desired_location(self):
            response = self.client.get('/people/')
            self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
            self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'person_list.html')
    ```

3. **Testing Forms**

    Test form validation and data handling using Django’s `Form` class.

    ```python
    from .forms import PersonForm

    class PersonFormTest(TestCase):
        def test_form_valid_data(self):
            form = PersonForm(data={'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30})
            self.assertTrue(form.is_valid())
    ```            

4. **Running Tests**

    Run all tests using:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py test
    ```

Testing helps ensure that changes do not introduce new issues and maintains a high-quality codebase over time.

## 17. Django REST Framework (DRF) Introduction

The Django REST Framework (DRF) is a toolkit for building APIs with Django. It simplifies API development with tools for serialization, authentication, and view organization.

### Key Components in DRF

1. **Serializers**: Convert complex data (like model instances) into JSON format and vice versa.
2. **ViewSets**: Encapsulate logic for handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in a single class.
3. **Routers**: Automatically generate URL patterns for ViewSets, providing RESTful routing for your API.

### Example: Creating a Simple API with DRF

1. **Creating a Serializer**

    Serializers are used to convert model instances to JSON format.

    ```python
    # myapp/serializers.py
    from rest_framework import serializers
    from .models import Person

    class PersonSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
        class Meta:
            model = Person
            fields = ['id', 'name', 'age', 'email']
    ```                

2. **Defining a ViewSet**

    ViewSets define the behavior of the API endpoint, handling CRUD operations automatically.

    ```python
    # myapp/views.py
    from rest_framework import viewsets
    from .models import Person
    from .serializers import PersonSerializer

    class PersonViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
        queryset = Person.objects.all()
        serializer_class = PersonSerializer
    ```

3. **Configuring URLs with a Router**

    Routers automatically create URLs for your ViewSet, simplifying routing setup.

    ```python
    # myapp/urls.py
    from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
    from .views import PersonViewSet

    router = DefaultRouter()
    router.register(r'people', PersonViewSet)

    urlpatterns = router.urls
    ```

Django REST Framework integrates smoothly with Django projects, providing a scalable solution for building RESTful APIs with minimal setup.

## 18. Best Practices in Django
Django encourages best practices through its conventions and tools. Here are some key guidelines:

1. **Follow Django’s Project Structure**: Keep projects organized by following Django’s standard file structure for apps, templates, static files, and media files.
2. **Use Virtual Environments**: Isolate dependencies using virtual environments (e.g., `venv`) to prevent conflicts between projects.
3. **Leverage the DRY Principle**: Reuse code by breaking down repeated patterns and using Django’s template inheritance, mixins, and generic views.
4. **Optimize Database Queries**: Use `select_related` and `prefetch_related` for related data access to reduce query counts.
5. **Write Tests**: Ensure code reliability by writing unit and integration tests. Django’s testing framework makes it easy to validate views, models, and forms.
6. **Implement Security Best Practices**: Use CSRF protection, secure passwords, SSL/HTTPS in production, and limit access through permissions and groups.
7. **Use Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information, such as secret keys and database credentials, in environment variables rather than hard-coding them in `settings.py`.

Following these best practices will help you maintain a clean, efficient, and secure Django application.
