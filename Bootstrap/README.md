Why This Approach Aligns with Your Goals
Targeted Learning: Each project is designed to build specific skills that directly contribute to the requirements of the ft_transcendence project.
Progressive Complexity: The projects are ordered from basic to advanced, allowing you to build upon your knowledge incrementally.
Practical Application: By working on these projects, you'll gain hands-on experience with the actual features you need to implement, such as real-time communication, user authentication, and game interfaces.
Alignment with Project Requirements: The updated project list covers key aspects like security measures, accessibility, and SPA development, which are crucial for your main project.
Next Steps
I recommend starting with Project 1: Introduction to Bootstrap and Responsive Design to familiarize yourself with the Bootstrap framework. Once comfortable, you can proceed sequentially or focus on projects that align closely with the immediate requirements of your ft_transcendence project.

Would you like to begin with the first project, or is there a specific area you'd like to focus on next? Feel free to let me know, and I can provide a detailed guide for that project, including step-by-step instructions and additional resources.

I'm here to support you throughout your learning journey, so don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions or need further clarification on any topic!
